Various things that need done:

MUST:

 * Actually do a release
 * D-Bus API and service
 * Metadata system for effect module discovery to allow external plugins easily
 * GNOME frontend
 * Key customization and macro bindings
 * Zone support (constrain effects to keyboard, media keys, touchpad, etc)
 * Animation parameter support for the commandline tool
 * A "generic" key-to-matrix mapping for other keyboards besides the Blade Pro
 * Screensaver / DPMS monitoring


WISHLIST:

 * More custom effects (plasma, zoomer, matrix, oldschool chunky demo effects!)
 * Renderer stats
 * Music visualizer
 * Trackpad "spotlight" effect


Neverending items:

 * More docs
 * Finish "extended matrix" support- I don't have any test hardware though!
 * Testing on more hardware!
 * Get rid of hardcoding of interface numbers and read the report descriptors
 * Fix the key used in the devices dict, it will break if multiple devices with the same
   model id are connected
 * Add more features to the commandline tool
 * Test coverage!
 * Developer needs additional beer! (PayPal: shade@chemlab.org)
 * All the things!
