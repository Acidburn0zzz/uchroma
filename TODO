Various things that need done:

 * Testing on lots of hardware!  I only have a Blade Pro laptop!
 * Improve the framebuffer API and implement a few cool animated effects with it
 * Device capabilities
 * Disable effects when the screen is turned off (without suspend)
 * Test coverage!
 * Developer needs additional beer! (PayPal: shade@chemlab.org)
 * All the things!
