Various things that need done:

 * Finish mouse support
 * Finish animation framework
 * Implement quirks system and ensure we're doing the right thing with odd hardware
 * Finish "extended matrix" support- I don't have any test hardware though!
 * Testing on more hardware!
 * Device capabilities
 * Get rid of hardcoding of interface numbers and read the report descriptors
 * Fix the key used in the devices dict, it will break if multiple devices with the same
   model id are connected
 * Add more features to the commandline tool
 * Figure out why we can't address the last column of the Blade Pro keyboard using 
   custom frame controls
 * Test coverage!
 * Developer needs additional beer! (PayPal: shade@chemlab.org)
 * All the things!
